\format{A data frame with 1728 observations on the following 7 variables,
where each row contains information on one car.
All variables are factor variables.

  \item{\code{persons}}{Capacity in terms of persons to carry
        (Levels: \code{2}, \code{4}, \code{more})}
  \item{\code{lug_boot}}{Size of luggage boot

\description{
This is the 'Car Evaluation' data set from 
the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
\cr
The Car Evaluation Database gives the acceptance 
of a car directly related to the six input attributes:
buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.
}
\details{
Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical
decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX. 

 The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:
 CAR                      car acceptability
 . PRICE                  overall price
 . . buying               buying price
 . . maint                price of the maintenance
 . TECH                   technical characteristics
 . . COMFORT              comfort
 . . . doors              number of doors
 . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
 . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
 . . safety               estimated safety of the car

Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target
concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts:
PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. 

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural 
information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input 
attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.
