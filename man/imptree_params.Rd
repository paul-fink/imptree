\usage{
imptree_params(args, method)
}
\arguments{
\item{args}{Named list containing the arguments to be processed.
May be \code{NULL} for default values. See details.}

\item{method}{Probability method as character, as supplied to \code{\link{imptree}}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the sanitized and validated parameters.

\description{
Initializing and validating the essential probability method specific parameters
}
\details{
For all methods \code{args} takes the following inputs:
 \itemize{
 \item{s}{: Hyperparamter of the Imprecise Dirichlet Model
   (\code{s >= 0}), see below.}
 \item{correction}{: Entropy correction to be carried out
   (Default \code{"no"}), see below.}
 \item{splitmetric}{: Split criterion to use
   (Default \code{"globalmax"}), see below.}
 }
 The hyperparamter \code{s} of the Imprecise Dirchlet Model (IDM) may
 be given as any non-negative value.  It defines the impression the locally
 applied IDMs introduce. With increasing values of \code{s} more impression is
 added. For \code{s=0} the IDM collapses to a Precise Dirichlet Model.
 This value is ignored for \code{method = "NPI"}.
 
 To account for a varying number of categories of the splitting candidates
 Strobl proposed the use of a correction based on the Miller-entropy
 correction: \code{correction = "strobl"}.
 In their work Abellan and Moral favoured for the IDM the use of a
 generalized Hartley measure such that the final measure may be viewed as
 measure of total uncertainty: \code{correction = "abellan"}.
 This correction method is not available for \code{method = "NPI"}.
 
 When deciding for split canditates a split criterion is applied.
 \code{"globalmax"} splits on maximal entropy of local models (with a
 global IDM parameter \code{s}).
 For \code{"range"} the splitting variable is found by taking the whole
 entropy interval into account.
 \code{localmax} is only available for IDM and split on maximal entropy,
 however with \code{s} dependent on the number of missing values in the class
 variable in the node
