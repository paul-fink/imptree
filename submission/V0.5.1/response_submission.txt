Re-submission
Requested changes:
* Please do not capitalize "Imprecise", "Model", "Nonparametric Predictive Inference", and "Imprecise Information" in your Description text. 
+ The respective words are now no longer capitalized in the Description field of DESCRIPTION, as well as in all Rd files

* Please add small executable examples in your Rd-files. 
+ All Rd files contain now examples displaying some calls to the documented functions. Main example (previously in imptree.Rd) moved to imptree-package.Rd

Further (unrequested) changes:
+ Corrected the previously wrongly stated default value of 'tbase' in imptree_control.Rd (mismatch between code and documentation)
+ Explicit table format in the Details section in carEvaluation.Rd (was illegible in PDF-version)
