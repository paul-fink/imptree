Description: This package implements the creation of imprecise
    classification trees using a local Imprecise Dirichlet Model
    or the Nonparametric Predictive Inference approach in each node.
    The approach in Fink and Crossman (2013)
    <http://www.sipta.org/isipta13/index.php?id=paper&paper=014.html>
    is implemented, but it also covers the original approach of building.
