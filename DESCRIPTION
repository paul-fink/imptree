Description: Creation of Imprecise classification trees. They rely on 
    probability estimation within each node by means of either the 
    Imprecise Dirichlet Model or the Nonparametric Predictive 
    Inference approach. The splitting variable is selected by the 
    strategy presented in Fink and Crossman (2013,
    <http://www.sipta.org/isipta13/index.php?id=paper&paper=014.html>),
    but also the original Imprecise Information Gain  of Abellan and 
    Moral (2003, <doi:10.1002/int.10143>) is covered.
